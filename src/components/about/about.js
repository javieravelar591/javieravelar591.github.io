                    I'm a motivated, collaborative, and empathetic developer driven by my mission to make making technology accessible for the betterment of everyone.
                    I believe my experience and education in software development have enabled me to collaborate and communicate effectively with cross-disciplinary team members to 
                    create effecient, effective, and empathetic solutions. <br />
                    <br />
                    <h2>A little more about me:</h2> <br />
                    I'm a first-generation Latinx student who has recently completed a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I grew up in an immigrant household with limited-English speaking parents. As a result,
                    I've witnessed firsthand the repercussions of non-accessible technology and unempathetic solutions. This fuels my commitment to creating solutions that break down barriers and serve diverse communities.
                    <br />
                    As a tech enthusiast, I make it a point to stay on the pulse of the industry, constantly absorbing the latest news and trends. It's my way of staying connected to the dynamic landscape of innovation.
                    I am extremely interested in the field of Artificial Intelligence and its applications to increase the standard of living.
                    <br />
                    When I'm not immersed in the tech world, you'll find me engaged in the art of combat sports, skateboarding, or simply enjoying of a well-brewed cup of coffee &#9749;
